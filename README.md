# golang_loader_assist.py
This is the `golang_loader_assist.py` code to accompany the blog I wrote, [Reversing GO binaries like a pro (in IDA Pro)](http://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/). There is also the `hello-go` directory which contains the simple hello world code I used as an example.
